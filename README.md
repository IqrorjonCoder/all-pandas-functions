<h3>Pandas is</h3>

    pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
    In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
    It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.
    The name is derived from the term "panel data",
    an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.
    Its name is a play on the phrase "Python data analysis" itself.
